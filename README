This is a GUI tool which was intended to be used as a interface to a server at one of my jobs. Its writing in Java using the swing class API. The ideal behind it is, it would log you into the server and the buttons you press would run scipts on the remote machine. The interface was going to be desinged to interface with the server via , server sockets. Please feel free to use this code if you need a template to work with on your project.

This project is yet to be completed due to access was needed to the server. Ideally all you would need is to create a servcesocketclient application.
